_______________________________________
For this assessment we implent a code quiz with the following qualities:

If you are taking a coding quiz, when you click the start button, a timer will begin and you will be given a question. When you answer the question, another one will be presented to you. If you answer a question incorrectly, time will be deducted from the clock. The game will be over when either all questions are answered or the timer runs out. Once the game is over, you can save your initials and your score.
